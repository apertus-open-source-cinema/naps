Introduction
============

.. todo: find / write a good introduction for fpga design in general

If you are not familiar with Amaranth HDL specifically or FPGA design in general, 
I recommend to start reading the `Amaranth HDL documentation <https://amaranth-lang.org/docs/amaranth/>`__. 

Generally I think that image processing is a great way to get started with FPGA
design and Amaranth is especially a good start. Probably you will experience
many rough edges and some frustration but also for me mMigen and this project were
the first big project with reconfigurable hardware :).
