Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation of `naps` - a collection of cores and infrastructure around Amaranth HDL to help with
rapid prototyping of FPGA based designs on different platforms. It was originally written
for developing gateware for cameras developed by the `Apertus collective <https://apertus.org>`__ but has
since been used (mostly by its authors) for various other projects and experiments.
Generally I think that image processing is a great way to get started with FPGA
design and Amaranth is especially a good start. Probably you will experience
many rough edges and some frustration but also for me Amaranth and this project were
the first big project with reconfigurable hardware :).

The docs in here are currently in a very rough state but might be able to give you some impression on
whats included in naps and how to get started. The docs here assume that you are (at least a bit)
familiar with Amaranth HDL specifically and FPGA design in general. If you are not,
I recommend to start reading the `Amaranth HDL documentation <https://amaranth-lang.org/docs/amaranth/>`__.
